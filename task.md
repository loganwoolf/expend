# Database Foundation Setup

**Status:** AwaitingCommit
**Agent PID:** 11160

## Original Todo

- Set up Turso database schema for income, budget categories, and expenses
- Configure database connection and migrations
- Create database models/types in TypeScript
- Set up environment variables for database connection

## Description

Setting up the complete database foundation for the Expend budget tracking application using Turso (SQLite-based) database with Drizzle ORM. This includes creating the database schema for users, income sources, budget categories, and expenses, along with TypeScript models and environment configuration.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Install Turso and Drizzle ORM dependencies (`@libsql/client`, `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `dotenv`)
- [x] Create database configuration file (src/db/config.ts)
- [x] Set up environment variables for Turso connection (.env.example and .env)
- [x] Create database schema with Drizzle (src/db/schema.ts) - users, income_sources, budget_categories, expenses, budget_periods, import_batches tables
- [x] Generate TypeScript types from schema (src/types/database.ts)
- [x] Create database client instance (src/db/index.ts)
- [x] Set up migration system with drizzle-kit configuration
- [x] Add database scripts to package.json (migrate, generate, studio)
- [x] Create initial migration files
- [x] Test database connection and basic CRUD operations

## Notes

Database foundation has been fully implemented with:
- Complete schema for users, income sources, budget categories, budget periods, budget allocations, expenses, and import batches
- Proper TypeScript types generated from schema
- Database configuration with Turso integration
- Migration system set up with initial migration created
- Test connection script with comprehensive CRUD testing
- All scripts added to package.json for database management

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the budget tracking application. To test with real data, create a .env file with actual Turso credentials and run the test connection script.
