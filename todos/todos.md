- User management
- Session handling and security

### Backend API Agent
**Responsibility:** Phase 3 (API portions), 6, 7
- Netlify Functions setup
- API endpoint implementation
- Business logic and validation

### Frontend Core Agent
**Responsibility:** Phases 4, 5, 6 (UI portions)
- Core application pages and forms
- State management
- User interface components

### Data Import Agent
**Responsibility:** Phase 7
- CSV parsing and import functionality
- Data validation and mapping
- Import user experience

### Analytics Agent
**Responsibility:** Phase 8
- Reporting and analytics features
- Data visualization
- Performance metrics

### PWA Agent
**Responsibility:** Phase 9
- Progressive web app configuration

- Mobile optimization

### QA Agent
**Responsibility:** Phase 10
- Testing implementation
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility compliance

### DevOps Agent
**Responsibility:** Phase 11
- Deployment automation
- Production configuration
- Monitoring setup

## Dependencies Between Phases
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (user tables in database)
- Phases 4-8 depend on Phases 1-3 (foundation)
- Phase 9 can run parallel to Phases 6-8
- Phase 10 requires completion of all feature phases
- Phase 11 is final deployment phase

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Duration:** 8-12 weeks
- **Critical Path:** Database � Auth � Core Backend � Features � PWA � Testing � Deploy
- **Parallel Work Opportunities:** UI development can happen alongside backend API work after Phase 3
